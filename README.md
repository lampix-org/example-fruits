# NNC & MBS example: fruits

**IMPORTANT**: This example simply showcases the steps building an app, but it is meant to run only in the simulator, as **fruits** is not a neural network we currently provide. 

It will be provided in the future, with oranges, lemons and limes at first, and the app adjusted to take into account the varying sizes of the physical elements. Right now, the size isn't taken into consideration.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lampix-org/example-fruits.git
cd example-fruits
npm install
npm start
```

## Usage

* Open up a Lampix simulator
* Load the address specified in the output of `npm start`, usually `http://localhost:8080`, but may differ based on port availability
